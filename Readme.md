Brewer is a paned coffeescript editor (much like the one found on the coffeescript website) that uses the ace editor for syntax highlighting etc and nodejs to provide saving functionality.

To use, checkout Brewer and then init the submodules:

	git clone https://github.com/rbrcurtis/Brewer.git
	cd Brewer
	git submodule update --init

Then you can run the Brewer.sh script which should work fine on linux and mac machines using Firefox, or run the server.coffee script manually and point your browser to http://localhost:8000
